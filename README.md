This project is a game where you can dynamically "cut land" in whichever angle anywhere on enemy land and instantly add it to your nation.
The game was too complicated to finish properly within the 48 hours and therefore there are some bugs, especially with "nation islands" (
where one player is encircled by another player).

## Motivation
My motivation behind making this game was to recreate a outdoors game I used to play in middleschool of which we called "Kappa land". 
There you use a knife instead of a cursor and you divide lines in the soil instead of colors on a screen.
